# Project Rules
- **Component Placement**: 
  - Main views/pages go in `src/pages/`.
  - Reusable UI elements go in `src/components/`.
  - Complex UI components (Dialogs, Popovers) should favor `shadcn/ui` conventions, though current components are custom Tailwind-built for specific "Clara" aesthetics.
- **Routing**: Keep all route definitions in `src/App.tsx`.
- **Styling Conventions**:
  - Always use Tailwind CSS classes.
  - Utilize the design tokens defined in `src/index.css` (e.g., `text-primary`, `bg-surface`, `border-surface-border`).
  - Support both Light and "Soft Warm Light" (Clara Dark) modes using the `.dark` class.
- **Data Management**:
  - Use `src/hooks/useData.ts` as the central point for data access.
  - Mock data is located in `src/mocks/` for development.
  - Business logic/Services are located in `src/services/`.
- **Icons**: Exclusively use `lucide-react`. Ensure icons are sized consistently (usually `w-4 h-4` or `w-5 h-5`).
- **Development Workflow**:
  - The main entry point is `src/pages/Index.tsx`.
  - Always update `Index.tsx` to include or link to new features/components to ensure visibility in the preview.
